# Survey Repository

Store exported survey responses and summary reports for the SpiralReality AIT
community event here.

## Structure
- `raw/`: Restricted access exports (not committed).
- `public/`: Sanitised aggregates safe for publication.
- `templates/`: Questionnaires in Markdown or form-builder formats.

Include a `metadata.json` file alongside each published survey summarising the
collection window, number of responses, and anonymisation steps applied.
